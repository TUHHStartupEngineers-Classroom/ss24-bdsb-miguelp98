The packages under the tidyverse umbrella help us in performing and interacting with the data. There are a whole host of things you can do with your data, such as subsetting, transforming, visualizing, etc.\n\nIn this section we will study the **sales of bikes** through bikes stores in Germany.\nWe will work with a database provided by [Canyon](https://cloud.tuhh.de/index.php/s/Cxe7YSM8RY2SgCn)\n\nAfter clean all the data we are showing *two* different tasks.\n\n---\n\n### CHALLENGE 1: Revenue by State\n\nIn the column bar plot you can see the <u>Revenue by State</u> . As we can see the state of **North Rhine-Westphalia** is the one that has highest Revenue.\n\n> It is recommended to expand the pictures to see them properly.\n\n::: {.cell hash='01_tidyverse_cache/html/plot1_acbca8a8f548fd88d1cc21a594bb485e'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01_tidyverse_files/figure-html/plot1-1.png){width=1728}\n:::\n:::\n\n### CHALLENGE 2: Sales by location and year\n\nIn the image below we are separating the images for each state in each year. This will give us 12 different bar charts.\n\n::: {.cell hash='01_tidyverse_cache/html/plot2_1328626ec76893ced1db1050c1970def'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01_tidyverse_files/figure-html/plot2-1.png){width=1728}\n:::\n:::",
